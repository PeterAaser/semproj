\begin{abstract}
  The human brain acts as a vastly parallel, self organizing computer far
  surpassing silicon processors in robustness, plasticity and energy
  efficiency.
  To gain an understanding into how the brain works a cyborg (short for
  cybernetic organism) is currently being made in an interdisciplinary effort
  known as the \textit{NTNU cyborg project}.
  In this paper we explore applying a relatively novel machine learning
  technique, \textit{reservoir computing}, to harness the computational power of
  living neural networks.
  These living cultures of neurons have been successfully grown at the
  department of neuromedicine hospital in \textit{Micro Electrode Arrays} which
  allow them to be interfaced with using electrical stimuli and readouts.
  Using the theoretical foundation of reservoir computing these \textit{In
    Vitro} neural networks are used to control a simple agent in a simulation on
  a remote computer.
  Finally we suggest an extension to the idea of cybernetic organisms, extending
  the idea of a cyborg as a hybrid organism between the biological and mechanic
  into \textit{RC cyborg}, a robot which utilizes reservoir computing.
  To this end a software framework is described, facilitating the use of several
  different reservoirs in addition to neural cultures to be used without
  drastically changing the code base, enabling different reservoirs to be
  studied in a similar context.
