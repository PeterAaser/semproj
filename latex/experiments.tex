In order to show in vitro neuron cultures being viable reservoirs we have
constructed a very simple simulated environment where an agent is placed in a
2D top down environment. The goal of this simulated game is to avoid walls while
exploring (that is, covering ground in order to punish agents that run in
circles or stand still).
In this experiment we wish to show that the neuron reservoir enhances the
performance
