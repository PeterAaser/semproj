Reservoir Computing is a novel approach to machine learning, using reservoirs
containing dynamic complex systems as computational elements. 
\cite{schrauwen_overview_2007}
Many different systems have been used as reservoirs, ranging from
virtual reservoirs such as random boolean networks and recurrent neural nets,
to real physical systems such as nano-carbon tubes.
Building on previous work we investigate using in-vitro neuron cultures as
reservoirs, describing the necessary infrastructure for performing such
experiments with live neurons. The primary concern of this paper will be the
architecture necessary for embodiment of blah blah blah
