\subsection{Exploring Reservoirs}
Only neural networks and random boolean networks have been used as reservoirs in
this project. 
One of the stated goals of the RC cyborg platform is to facilitate the use of a
wide range of reservoirs ranging from recurrent artificial neural networks, to
more exotic physical reservoirs.
By comparing performance of different reservoirs for the same task different
characteristics impacting performance of RC systems may be explored.
\subsection{Investigating Neuron Growth Rules}
Neural cultures change their own structure in response to stimuli, which in turn
is a result of their structure.
This interplay between self-organization and current dynamics of the neural
network is not well understood, but it may have a profound impact on creating
artificial neural networks imitating their biological counterparts.
One experiment that might shed light on this process is to observe the
differences in regularity between neural networks who have been subjected to
random stimuli compared to cultures who have experienced regular stimuli.
\subsection{Integrating Machine Learning}
In order for SHODAN to support on-line adaptivity tools for machine learning is
required.
A framework for genetic algorithms in scala, scalapagos \cite{scalapagos}, will
be integrated with SHODAN allowing exploration of the parameter spaces both for
reservoirs themselves and for data processing filters.
