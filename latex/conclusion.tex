A working solution for the architectural challenges for interfacing a robot with
a neural cultures has completed a proof of concept test, showing that the remaining
efforts for the cyborg project is harnessing the computations performed by the neural
network.
By proposing the RC cyborg concept as a broader definition of a cyborg the
foundation has been laid for exploring differences between neural networks and other
reservoirs used in the same contextual ``harness'' such that the differences between
reservoirs may be studied quantitatively as well as qualitatively.
With the theoretical and practical framework needed to interface with neural network
the cyborg project is now equipped to explore the fundamental aspects of neural
computation.
